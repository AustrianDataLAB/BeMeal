# Branch protection guidlines

## Context and Problem Statement
If the pipeline is executed a new image of the front-/backend application should be deployed. The front- and backend image are build seperatly. The possibility to deploy "quick fixes"/"hot fixes" should be possible even if a build "fails" (e.g. does not pass the vulnerability scan or integration tests).

(However since this is a private development and urgend hotfixes will not be necessary, this rule will only get implemented, if the team finds the time to do so)

## Decision Drivers
* The `main` branch should be kept in a consistent state
* The team is able to deploy quick hot fixes 

## Considered Options
* The builds have to succeed no matter what branch
* Not all image builds need to pass

## Decision Outcome
- On the `main` branch, both images have to build without errors.
- On other branches (like feature, fix, ...) or in merge request, it is sufficient, if one of the two images manages to build

### Consequences
* Good, because the `main` branch is kept in a consistent state
* Good, if really necessary the team can deploy important fixes right away, without having to worry about passing the pipeline
* Bad, because insecure or "failed" build can be deployed

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Confirmation
The ADR is confirmed when both front- & backend in the `main` branch are kept in a passing state. For other branches it is okay if the pipeline fails, but (if at all possible) a image should still be created, even if some checks fail for this image.
