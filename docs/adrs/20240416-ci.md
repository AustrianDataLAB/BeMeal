# Decision on CI

## Context and Problem Statement

A definition is required on how much vulnerabilities are allowed in the built images.
Furthermore, the amount of testing has to be defined as well.

## Considered Options

Blockers:
* None
* Build failures
* Vulnerabilites
* Image Signatures
* 


Vulnerabilites:
* Allow every vulnerability
* Allow certain classes of vulnerabilites
* Allow a threshold of vulnerabilites

Meaningful Tests:
* Infrastructure Availbility
* 

## Decision Outcome

Blockers: Vulnerabilites, Build Failures because Image signatures are considered out of scope of this course
Vulnerabilites: 
### Consequences

* Good, because {positive consequence, e.g., improvement of one or more desired qualities, …}
* Bad, because {negative consequence, e.g., compromising one or more desired qualities, …}
* … <!-- numbers of consequences can vary -->

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Confirmation

{Describe how the implementation of/compliance with the ADR is confirmed. E.g., by a review or an ArchUnit test.
 Although we classify this element as optional, it is included in most ADRs.}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Pros and Cons of the Options

### {title of option 1}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
<!-- use "neutral" if the given argument weights neither for good nor bad -->
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}
* … <!-- numbers of pros and cons can vary -->

### {title of other option}

{example | description | pointer to more information | …}

* Good, because {argument a}
* Good, because {argument b}
* Neutral, because {argument c}
* Bad, because {argument d}
* …
